# CodeSnippet : NodeJS project

This node.js app is my second app. CodeSnippets is a CRUD application where i tried to use what i've leaned of how to work with:

- Express
- Mongoose
- Google OAuth
- Passport
- Session / Cookies : using Express-session 
- Connect-monogo to store sessions in the DB
- Handlebars as template engine 
- method-Override to make "PUT" and "DELETE" requests from the templates
- Materialized Framework

The app demonstrates using MVC approach how to set up an authentication system using Node Express, MongoDB and passport, Google OAuth where useres can sign up and log in and log out, also how to protect certain routes or pages from unauthenticated users.
The user can add its code snippets and edit them also see the public code snippets of other users.
